# Binary File Patch - Complete Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and verified a patch to fix binary file handling in the PowerShell version of Extract-FileVersionsFromGit.

## Problem Statement
The original script used `Out-File -Encoding UTF8` for all files, which corrupted binary files when using the `-IncludeBinaryFiles` switch.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Functions

#### `Test-BinaryFile` (Lines ~195-220)
**Changes:**
- Added Git's native `diff --numstat` for reliable binary detection
- Improved null-byte fallback detection with proper boolean casting
- Fixed array-to-boolean conversion issues

#### `Export-FileFromCommit` (Lines ~220-320)
**Changes:**
- Added `[bool]$IsBinary` parameter
- Implemented dual-path extraction:
  - **Binary files:** Use CMD.exe redirection (byte-safe)
  - **Text files:** Use CMD.exe with UTF-8 code page (encoding-safe)
- Both paths use temporary CMD scripts to avoid PowerShell encoding issues

#### Main Processing Loop (Lines ~380-410)
**Changes:**
- Always detect binary status before extraction
- Pass binary status to `Export-FileFromCommit`
- Updated logic flow for better handling

### 2. Technical Approach

#### Binary Files
```powershell
# Create CMD script for binary-safe extraction
"@echo off`ngit show `"${CommitHash}:${FilePath}`" > `"$outputFilePath`" 2>nul"
```
- No encoding applied
- Direct byte stream to file
- Zero data corruption

#### Text Files
```powershell
# Create CMD script with UTF-8 code page
"@echo off`nchcp 65001 >nul`ngit show `"${CommitHash}:${FilePath}`" > `"$outputFilePath`" 2>nul"
```
- UTF-8 code page (65001) for proper encoding
- Preserves multi-byte characters
- Maintains line endings

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `powershell/Extract-FileVersionsFromGit.ps1` | ~195-320, ~380-410 | Core patch implementation |
| `test/Test-BinaryPatch.ps1` | New file | Comprehensive test suite |
| `test/TEST_RESULTS.md` | New file | Test verification report |
| `PATCH_NOTES.md` | New file | Technical documentation |
| `BINARY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` | New file | Quick reference guide |

## Test Results

### âœ… All Tests Passed (5/5)

1. **PNG Binary Files** - Byte-perfect extraction verified
2. **ZIP Binary Files** - Byte-perfect extraction verified
3. **Generic Binary Data** - Byte-perfect extraction verified
4. **UTF-8 Text Files** - Content and encoding preserved
5. **Directory Structure** - Hierarchy maintained

### Test Coverage
- Binary file types: PNG, ZIP, generic binary
- Text encoding: UTF-8 with special characters (Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼, Ã±, ä¸­æ–‡, ðŸŽ‰)
- Directory structures: Subdirectories preserved
- Multiple commits: Version history maintained
- File integrity: MD5 hash verification

## Benefits

âœ… **No Data Corruption** - Binary files extracted byte-for-byte  
âœ… **UTF-8 Support** - Multi-byte characters and emoji preserved  
âœ… **Backward Compatible** - No breaking changes  
âœ… **Reliable Detection** - Uses Git's native binary detection  
âœ… **Clean Implementation** - Proper error handling and cleanup  

## Usage

### Extract All Files (Text Only)
```powershell
.\Extract-FileVersionsFromGit.ps1 -RepositoryPath "C:\MyRepo"
```

### Extract Including Binary Files
```powershell
.\Extract-FileVersionsFromGit.ps1 -RepositoryPath "C:\MyRepo" -IncludeBinaryFiles
```

### Run Tests
```powershell
cd test
.\Test-BinaryPatch.ps1
```

## Verification Steps

1. âœ… Code implemented and tested
2. âœ… No syntax errors
3. âœ… All automated tests pass
4. âœ… Binary file integrity verified (MD5 hash)
5. âœ… Text encoding verified (UTF-8 special chars)
6. âœ… Directory structure verified
7. âœ… Performance acceptable (<3 seconds for test repo)
8. âœ… Error handling tested
9. âœ… Cleanup functionality verified
10. âœ… Documentation complete

## Known Limitations

1. **Platform:** Windows-only (uses CMD.exe)
2. **Performance:** Small overhead from temporary CMD scripts
3. **Binary Detection:** Rare edge cases might misidentify files

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Cross-platform support (use .NET FileStream instead of CMD)
- Streaming for very large files
- Hash verification option
- Progress for individual large files
- Parallel extraction support

## Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PATCH_NOTES.md` | Detailed technical explanation |
| `BINARY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` | Quick reference and examples |
| `test/TEST_RESULTS.md` | Test verification report |
| `test/Test-BinaryPatch.ps1` | Automated test suite |

## Conclusion

The patch successfully resolves the binary file corruption issue while maintaining backward compatibility and adding proper UTF-8 text file support. All tests pass, and the implementation is ready for production use.

**Status:** âœ… **VERIFIED AND READY FOR USE**
